            <p>Proper fuel delivery is essential to the performance of any vehicle. Dirty and clogged fuel injectors will reduce your fuel economy and rob 
                horsepower. A completely stock vehicle could benefit from fuel injector cleaning and testing.

        <h2 class="spacing" id="maintenance">Recommended Maintenance Before Tuning</h2>
        <div class="packages">
            <p>
                Check all your fluids: <br>-Oil, Coolant, Transmission, Transfer Case, and Rear Differential. <b>Ensure that all are clean and full.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Boost Leak Test: <br>-This will be needed to be done before your tune. Boost leaks can cause major drivability issues and will make it impossible to tune your setup to its full potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fuel: <br>-If you plan on getting a Dual Map Tune on different fuels, make sure that before your tune, the vehicle is a little under a third a tank full on gas. We will be needing a near empty 
                tank when switching fuel maps and if your vehicle is near full on gas, that will extend the time needed in order to tune your vehicle. Also, if you plan to tune on E85, test the mixture from the station 
                you plan on getting most of your fuel from.
