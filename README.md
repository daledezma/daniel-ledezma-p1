#ECULink Tuning

##Project Plan

For my project, I will be producing a website that offers remote car tuning services for Mitsubishi Evo X and Ralliart vehicles. I will be naming the website ECULink Tuning. In short, users who access the site will be in need of car tuning services once modifications are made to their car to optimize it for a different set of performance requirements from what it was originally designed to meet from the factory. 

On the featured list of the website, I will create a store model on the page for the tuning packages offered and information on them which will retrieve the info from my JavaScript file.

The page will offer a Fuel Injectors cleaning option. Once selected, users will then be needing to choose a Cleaning or Cleaning and Testing option. Information on price will be injected into the page from the javascript file.
